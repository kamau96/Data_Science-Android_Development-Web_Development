    "# Below is how I approach the Movie project\n",
    "### 1. Frame the Problem and Look at the Big Picture\n",
    "1. Define the objective in business terms.\n",
    "    - There are two objectives namely:\n",
    "        1. Knowing the projected revenue.\n",
    "        2. Determinig customer interests.\n",
    "2. How will your solution be used?\n",
    "    - By companies trying to understand their profits.\n",
    "    - Movie lovers can get recommendation of movies.\n",
    "3. What are the current solutions/workarounds (if any)?\n",
    "    - Can get data from TMDB and Rotten tomatoes (currently use kaggle data).\n",
    "    - For data analysis and machine learning assume no solutions.\n",
    "4. How should you frame this problem (supervised/unsupervised,online/offline, etc.)?\n",
    "    - Supervised and batch learning.\n",
    "        NB: online learning might be possible. Will experiment at end of project.\n",
    "5. How should performance be measured?\n",
    "    - For revenue predictions RSME will be used.\n",
    "    - For recommender system F1-score will be used.\n",
    "        NB: For both models will experiment other performance measures. \n",
    "6. Is the performance measure aligned with the business objective?\n",
    "    - For current business needs yes.\n",
    "    - However, if this is a real world scenario I believe not.\n",
    "7. What would be the minimum performance needed to reach the business objective?\n",
    "    - For revenue a score of 94% is acceptable. \n",
    "    - For recommender system generating high recall score is preferable. \n",
    "8. What are comparable problems? Can you reuse experience or tools?\n",
    "    - Assume none exist.\n",
    "9. Is human expertise available?\n",
    "    - Assume no.\n",
    "10. How would you solve the problem manually?\n",
    "    - For revenue talking to people in movie industry.\n",
    "    - For recommendor asking random people.\n",
    "11. List the assumptions you (or others) have made so far.\n",
    "    - None identified at this point. \n",
    "12. Verify assumptions if possible.\n",
    "    - None to verify. "
